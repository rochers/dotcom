            I am a technology executive with experience across product management, engineering, design, product strategy, and growth. As the Director of Digital Product Development for <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com">Blue Bottle Coffee</a>, I help define, build, and launch thriving eCommerce products. Previously, I was Chief Technology Officer for Tonx which was <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/blue-bottle-tonx-handsome/">acquired</a> by Blue Bottle in April 2014.

            In the past, I worked as a Front End Engineer for Yahoo! Entertainment, helping build the next generation of global Movie and TV websites. As an early employee and lead engineer at daily deal startups FamilyFinds and Half Off Depot, I helped to significantly grow revenues by expanding the capabilities of our ecommerce platforms. In May 2010, I built and sold a food truck mapping aggregator called Cluster Truck, to a local entrepreneur.
